Description: A Boat Instrument for displaying SignalK data
 A Boat Instrument for displaying data in fully configurable Boxes. The data is
 received via a subscription to a SignalK server.

 The SignalK server should be fed from your boat's NMEA data. The SignalK server
 can run on any supported platform, but this is usually a Raspberry Pi running a
 marine specific OS build.

Description: A light-weight Flutter Engine Embedder for the Raspberry Pi
 Flutter-pi also runs without X11, so you don't need to boot into Raspbian Desktop & have X11 and
 LXDE load up; just boot into the command-line.
 .
 You can now theoretically run every flutter app you want using flutter-pi, including apps using
 packages & plugins, just that you'd have to build the platform side of the plugins you'd like to use yourself.
 .
 The difference between packages and plugins is that packages don't include any native code, they are just pure Dart.
